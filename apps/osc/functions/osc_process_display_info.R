  # the app is supposed to: 
  # 1. recieve the pulled information from certain hints via osc_pull_display_info - which differentiates for editor versus freelancer
  # 2. the data is transformed from wide to long in the osc_pull_display_info, the app needs to dissassemble the " ; " separated urls / comments (sorted by descending date) to display them
  # 3. - urls are separated by ' ; ' into some boxes which the editors can drag and drop into categories (off. news, consult, other)
  # 4a. - for the freelancer: mark those rows which were processed as green, neutral as in not processed 
  #     - only use osc_process_display on those which were processed!
  #     - was.modified does not exist for the freelancer, everything that is green is considered to have been modified (i assume the freelancer is going to be adding nearly always some sort of modification, the editor not, so i don't care as much if the processing speed is lost on freelancer if he changes 90% of hints, but editor only changes 10%)
  # 4b. - for the editor: mark those rows which were processed as either green (was.accepted = 1) or red (was.accepted = 0), this determines if the hint goes back to freelancer or moves to next stage
  #     - was.accepted = NA doesn't get fed into the osc_process_display
  #     - set to each modified hint, was.modified to 1 if this hint's urls / files are changed (avoids unnecessary accessing of tables / computing), set was.modified = 0 if editor is just confirming what freelancer did but with no amendments
  # 5. reminder: this is all done with a wide dataframe with ' ; ' separating urls if there are multiple within the same type (off. , news, consult, other), the submitted dataframe is also wide and this function itself makes the df long
  # 6. "new.comment" is the column which this function picks up for new comments
  # 7. feed this into the osc_process_display_info with a submit button somewhere (not automatic)
  # 8. remove those hints which were processed from display (if the freelancer submits twice the same hint without it being sent back to him by the editor, we are in trouble, function doesn't support this)
